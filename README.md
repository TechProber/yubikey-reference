## Multiple Keys

Reference: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#multiple-yubikeys

To import the existing key to `another` YubiKey, follow the steps below

### Steps to reproduce

#### Step [0] - Backup your existing master key

```bash
# list existing master key, and get the key id
gpg -K

mkdir -p ~/.local/creds
gpg --export-secret-key --armor <key id> > ~/.local/creds/GPG_key.backup
```

#### Step [1] - Switch between two or more Yubikeys

Reference: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#switching-between-two-or-more-yubikeys

```bash
# Insert the first Yubikey (which has a different serial number) and run the following command
gpg-connect-agent "scd serialno" "learn --force" /bye
```

Notes:

- GPG will then scan your first Yubikey for GPG keys and recreate the stubs to point to the GPG keyID and Yubikey Serial number of this first Yubikey
- To return to using the second Yubikey just repeat (insert other Yubikey and re-run command).
- Obviously this command is not easy to remember so it is recommended to either create a script or a shell alias to make this more user friendly.

#### Step [2] - Delete the original key

Delete the original master key

```bash
# list existing master key, and get the key id
gpg -K

# delete the existing key
gpg --delete-secret-key <key id>
gpg --delete-key <key id>
```

#### Step [3] - Import the master key from backup

```bash
gpg --import ~/.local/creds/GPG_key.backup

# verify the result
gpg -K
gpg -k
```

#### Step [4] - Import the key to the new YubiKey

```bash
gpg --edit-key <key id>
```

Follow the procedures in https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP

#### Step [5] - Trust the imported key

```bash
gpg --edit-key <key id>
gpg> trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5

gpg> quit
```

#### Step [6] - Verify the result

```bash
# check if encryption and decryption
echo test | gpg --encrypt --recipient <your login email> | gpg --decrypt

# check ssh agent
ssh-add -L
```

## Keybase Usage

### Install Keybase CLI

```bash
yay -S keybase-bin
```

### Login to keybase

```bash
keybase login
```

### Import GPG Key-Pair (including the encrypted private key)

```bash
# Assume you have already backuped your master private key, if not run
gpg --export-secret-key --armor <key id> > <dir to save the key>

# Import the master key-pair to keybase
keybase pgp import --import-file > <dir where the key is stored> --push-secret
```

### Purge all GPGkeys from Keybase Keyring

Make sure your have saved your private key in a safe place

```bash
keybase pgp purge -p
```

### Export PGP Key-Pair from Keybase

```bash
# export public key
keybase pgp export > <dir>

# export private key
keybase pgp export --secret > <dir>
```

### Update Key-Pair to Keybase

```bash
keybase pgp update
```

### Git Signing Usage

Reference: https://gist.github.com/alopresto/b8d940197b4c314e27188a6852198d2d

Upload your key to Github followed by the [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/)

```bash
# enable signing for every git commit (optional)
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# reference the keyid that is used for signing
git config --global user.signingkey <keyid>

# test result
echo "hello" > test
git add test
git commit -S "this commit is signed by a GPG key"
git logs
```
